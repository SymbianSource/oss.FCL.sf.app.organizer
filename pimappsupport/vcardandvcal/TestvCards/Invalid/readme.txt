Invalid vCards

These fail to import in Versit - most of these don't meet the vCard specification

1.vcf	Seperated by CRCRLF rather than CRLF
2.vcf	Seperated by CRCRLF rather than CRLF (from ICQ application)
3.vcf	Seperated by CR rather than CRLF (orignally from Nokia 9110 but mangled)
4.vcf	Seperated by LF rather than CRLF 
5.vcf	Seperated by LF rather than CRLF
6.vcf	A version 3.0 vCard (Versit only supports v2.1 at present)
