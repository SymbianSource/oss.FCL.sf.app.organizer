Put 101F874B.cre in epoc32/winscw/c/private/10202be9/persists.

This is a temporary solution until the calendar central repository data gets updated in the platform to include the new plugin setting item.

Once the platform change has been made, 101F874B.cre and 101F874B.txt can be deleted from this directory.
